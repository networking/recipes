  * The <fg=blue>InitCmsBundle</> imports many configuration files, such as doctrine.yaml, security.yaml etc. In order
  to ensure your app will work please do the following:
    1. Check that all files imported via the networking_init_cms.yaml file are not overwritten with a similar
       configuration file in your /config/packages folder. !IMPORTANT the doctrine.yaml and security.yaml must be either
       deleted, or configured along the lines of the provided default doctrine and security configs provided in the
       bundle
    2. Check that the Page and User entities were copied to the correct entity folder, and are configured correctly
    3. Clear the cache again so that the new config files are loaded correctly.
    4. Back up your database.
    5. Update your database <fg=blue>bin/console doctrine:schema:update</> or using the doctrine migrate commands
    6. Use the command networking:initcms:install to install setup the DB install fixtures and create a superuser admin
    7. OR you can use the networking:initcms:data-setup if you just want to install the data structure and fixtures
    8. Enable or copy the security configuration file that is commented out in the networking_init_cms.yaml file
